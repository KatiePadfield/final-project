            <h3>Final design</h3>
            <p>For my poster designs I experimented with three different styles. I knew I wanted to keep a consistent colour scheme throughout and using illustrator I created a graphic of a hot air balloon to be used in them all. I started off wanting a monochromatic look using just blue an white as the colour scheme. I then added in my graphic but chose to place it place it slightly off the page. From there I wanted the text to form around the balloon as it was very subtle and I felt this gave it a more defined outline. From this poster I knew I liked how the text forming around the balloon looked however, the monochromatic colour scheme made the poster feel dull and did not catch the eye.
                <br>In my second design I decided to use the dilatational typographical system for the text. I still chose to keep element of the blue colour scheme in the previous design but made use of negative white space more. I also wanted to introduce a secondary colour and after some testing I chose orange as it the complementary colour to blue and their contrast made the poster stand out more. I also included the balloon graphic again but chose to centre it this time making it the focus of the poster as I feel this was better non-verbal communication for the poster as its target would also be children potential those who cannot read. 
                <br>For my third design I wanted to make more use of the complementary colours and chose to do so in a more sharp and angular way than before. By creating these very straight intersecting lines I though it added further contrast against the rounded balloons making it more attention grabbing and visual interesting. I then experimented with different layouts and orientation for the text but ultimately chose to use the axial typographic system as this kept the text fun but also very readable. 
                <br>Finally, I chose to develop upon my last design. It was very rigid and ordered a I felt for a poster like this it should have a more fun even playful effect. I tried to achieve this through simple changes to the balloons adding more and altering sizes and well as breaking across the structure I had previously created making it feel more connected and less disjointed.
