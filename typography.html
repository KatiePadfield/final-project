            <img class="typo-image" src="images/axial.png" alt="axial typography example">
            <h3>Axial</h3>
            <p>Axial typography focuses on text directed around an axis (line). For my piece I started with the pink line and then branched text off either side. I then saw I had a lot of negative space and I wanted to add in a shape to make it more visually interesting. I chose the rings as looking on the website for Kher’s exhibition the background image included a spiral which I was trying to emulate and include in the majority of the typographical systems.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <img class="typo-image" src="images/radial.png" alt="radial typography example">
            <h3>Radial</h3>
            <p>Radial typography is where text in arranged in lines at a normal to an arc. I chose the keep with my motif of the rings as I felt this was more appealing to look at than a solid shape and the branched text off from there. I also wanted to include some lines following the same direction as the text as I felt this broke up the text into section making it more readable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <img class="typo-image" src="images/circle.png" alt="dilatational typography example">
            <h3>Dilataional</h3>
            <p>Dilatational typography, similar to radial, involves an arc, however with dilatational the text forms the arc itself. I chose to split the text in the three arcs for this as I felt it made it clearer and gave it more structure. I didn’t choose to include the rings as I have done in the previous examples because I felt the text portrayed that effect nicely on its own and would become too distracting with the added shape. Instead, I opted to add in circles to fill some negative space as they tied in nicely with the typography without taking focus away from it.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <img class="typo-image" src="images/random.png" alt="random typography example">
            <h3>Random</h3>
            <p>Random typography has no rules to it, it is randomised and so text can be displayed in anyway. For this I chose to keep the most important details as readable as I could by orientating them in a way it was still quite clear what they said. For the shapes in the background I wanted to lower their transparency as I really like being able to see the layering and how the cross sections effected each other.</p>

    <div class="typography">
        <div class="column">
            <img class="typo-image" src="images/grid.png" alt="grid typography example">
            <h3>Grid</h3>
            <p>Grid typography is structed in a grid formation. For this I started with the transparent white bar at the top as I thought this simulated a header and added the pink one in as a footer as I liked the symmetry this crated. I thought for the grid adding in rectangles would be most appropriate, so I created the two boxes which gave the structure to pace my text around. I chose to keep these boxes transparent as I wanted the negative space but to then make it feel more contained. I then aligned my text to either side to create the straight edges of the grid.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <img class="typo-image" src="images/modular.png" alt="modular typography example">
            <h3>Modular</h3>
            <p>Modular typography is where text is placed in containers. I knew for this I wanted to include the rings again but for this I lowered the transparency and included a background to it as this made it more of a container.  For the three circles I wanted their container to overlap showing it was all connected and I liked how the transparency changed when the were place on top of each other. For the text I the placed it inside each circle and the adjusted the side to fill the shape as best as it could.</p>
