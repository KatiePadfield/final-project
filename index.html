        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Prior to starting this module, I had little to no foundational knowledge on graphic design and had only very briefly looked into some HTML and CSS before. I knew straight away though this would be something I would be really interested in and enjoy the process of a lot. 
            <br><br>The coding aspect to this module has so far been my favourite. I feel very accomplished in completing my first ever website having started only few months ago, not knowing anything to where I am now I can clearly see my progression. I had hoped to include more in this website and explore further in coding the different possibilities, but given the time constraints I am happy with what I have achieved for this website. 
            <br><br>The CARP portion of this project seemed really daunting to me initially. I do have some experience with a more art background, but I never had to design a poster like this before. It was a fun task, but I feel I had difficulty finding my starting point and the direction I wanted to take things in. Once I settled on making my own graphic for it I think the concepts for my posters came a lot easier to me. At the end of creating my posters I was happy with them, however I do wish I gave them more of my time to execute them to a higher standard. 
            <br><br>I had never really considered typography until I started this module but, it was something that surprised me how much I enjoyed it. Learning about all the different systems I think gave me a different perspective on design and I tried to include some going forward into my CARP task as well. I’m extremely happy with the final product of my typographical systems and also really enjoyed the process of learning about Illustrator to create them.
            <br><br>For the UX portion of this module I feel as if I didn’t put as much thought and consideration into it as I would’ve liked. I did briefly create a template for the general idea of what I wanted this website to look like and I feel as though I did achieve that but, I think it could’ve been made more interesting to be more engaging for the user. I did also plan to have a colour palette for this website and although I did end up using a portion of the colour palette, part of it was neglected in the design. I think this was due to the fact even though the palette worked on its own it did not translate as well to website so that is something I hope I can improve on as the course continues.
