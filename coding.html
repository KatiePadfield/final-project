            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>For the first couple weeks of our coding worksheets we were just learning how to structure and style our websites. I had done a small amount of coding in HTML before this course, but this gave a really good refresher to me with things like exact wording and setting everything up. These were really enjoyable weeks as I liked being able to see how my code changes the appearance of the website so drastically and being able to test out things and try different places etc.
                <br><br>In weeks five and six the focus was more on functionality. Learning about flexbox was really new to me and I did struggle initially to understand how what I typed affect the website, but through using it more on this website I feel I have a lot better understanding of it now. We also looked into anchor links as well which we helpful in creating the navigation bar on this website as well as in some other features.
